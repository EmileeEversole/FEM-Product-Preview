## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I normally work based on some source code or at least by referring back to something that I've written in the past. This time, however, I didn't allow myself to look at any other code. I really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the completed project and figuring out how to make it work. I feel that it was a good way to test my progress as I learn to code, and I'm excited to start the next project!


### Continued development

I will definitely continue to work on my CSS skills. I feel like, slowly, everything is coming together. However, I still struggle big-picture layouts and remembering how a property set within one element can effect another. I usually end up writing out all the code but it's a mess and some parts need to be tweaked, and then I write another page that's a little bit more organized. I hope to cut out that first page of code and learn to think ahead during the first go-around.

This is the first project that I'm publishing, but I have worked on quite a few others. Huge shoutout to my husband, Caleb, for listening to me ramble about my newest project/whatever I learned that day. Love you, darlin.
